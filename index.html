      These are the best athletes! Preamble Rap

I was running through the states with my votes!

Establishing rights [that’s how freedom goes (*2)] 

I was running through the states with my votes

Now… let’s go way back to 1787, The Articles of Confederation, they were definitely not in heaven, but then James Madison proposed a convention where the powers would be written, the rights would be given, and the people would livin’!

Speed it up 4 months, we got the new foundation, the articles (break) had no correlation with the new constitution!

Now we’ll hit you up with the 1st verse, the preamble!

(Say Preamble Slowly)

(Wait 5 seconds)

So now you know the duties of the people, living life with the rules from the ‘amble!

Some people say the people have too many duties, the others say they help us step into the light, but you know, who’s really right?

The Seattle Seahawks are a professional American football franchise based in Seattle, Washington. The Seahawks compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) West division. The Seahawks joined the NFL in 1976 as an expansion team, along with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Seahawks are owned by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and are currently coached by Pete Carroll. Since 2002, the Seahawks have played their home games at CenturyLink Field (formerly Qwest Field), located south of downtown Seattle. The Seahawks previously played home games in the Kingdome (1976–1999) and Husky Stadium (1994, 2000–2001).

The Seahawks are the only NFL franchise based in the Pacific Northwest region of North America, and thus attract support from a wide geographical area, including some parts of Oregon, Montana, Idaho, and Alaska, as well as Canadian fans in British Columbia and Alberta.[5]

Seahawks fans have been referred to collectively as the "12th Man",[6][7][8] "12th Fan",[9][10] or "12s".[11][12][13] The Seahawks' fans have twice set the Guinness World Record for the loudest crowd noise at a sporting event, first on September 15, 2013, registering 136.6 dB during a game against the San Francisco 49ers[14] and again on December 2, 2013, during a Monday Night Football game against the New Orleans Saints, with a then record-setting 137.6 dB.[15][16]

Over the years the Seahawks have had some notable players on the team, including Shaun Alexander, Brian Blades, Dave Brown, Kenny Easley, Joey Galloway, Jacob Green, Matt Hasselbeck, Steve Hutchinson, Walter Jones, Cortez Kennedy, Dave Krieg, Steve Largent, Joe Nash, Marcus Trufant, Curt Warner, and Jim Zorn, as well as briefly Hall of Famers Carl Eller, Franco Harris, Warren Moon, John Randle, and Jerry Rice. Largent (1995), Kennedy (2012), and Jones (2014) have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame primarily or wholly for their accomplishments as Seahawks. Brown, Easley, Green, Jones, Kennedy, Krieg, Largent, Warner, and Zorn have been inducted into the Seahawks Ring of Honor along with Pete Gross (Radio Announcer) and Chuck Knox (Head Coach).

The Seahawks have won nine division titles and three conference championships. They are the only team to have played in both the AFC and NFC Championship Games. They have appeared in three Super Bowls, including Super Bowl XLVIII, where they defeated the Denver Broncos 43–8 to win their first NFL title. However, the Seahawks went on to lose Super Bowl XLIX to the New England Patriots, 28–24. They are also the first, and to date only, post-merger expansion team in NFL history to play in consecutive Super Bowls.
